# Urbanburn web site
This repo contains the (static) web site for Stockholm Urban Burn.

# Deploy
The site is hosted on a linode server. See the [linode status page](https://linode.statuspage.io/) for 
information about outages and such.

The master branch is automatically deployed to the server. This is done by a pulling cron job that runs every minute.
Please keep work in progress on other branches until the work is ready to be published. If you don't have access to the repo
you could ask for it in [slack](https://urbanburn.slack.com/messages/it/) or 
[create a pull request](https://github.com/urbanburn/front/pulls).
