                        An event like nothing Stockholm has ever seen… For one weekend, we build another universe together. No passive consumers, only active participants.
                        Urban Burn is a participatory art event inspired by Burning Man. It’s an experiment in creative freedom & participation, conceived, built, experienced and returned to nothing by you! Urban Burn is a non-profit event.
                        We are renting 2 000 sqm of open indoor space at Nobelberget in Sickla from March 11 to 13, where everyone is invited to create anything they like.

                        You’ll need a ticket to participate in Urban Burn, which costs XXX SEK. You can buy it here. The money gathered for tickets is used for event expenses and project grants. We’re all creating this event on a voluntary basis, nobody gets paid.                    </div>

                        <p>Do you want to be part of this? To get a feeling what’s up, we invite you to take a look at some of the projects already planned.
                            You can either join one of those projects, or start your own. Some of us are supervising placement, so in case you start a project, it would be great to send a message to XXX and explain what kind of space and other requirements (such as electricity) you need.</p>

                        Instead of having specific rules, The Bizarre Star Bazaar is governed by common values, a way of looking at our community and how we do things together. These values are expressed through the 10 Principles, as written by Larry Harvey for the Burning Man community.

						Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.

						Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.
